Abstract— Unauthorized and unregistered sea going fishing
vessels are being used for criminal activities in the coastal areas.
The issue of piracy against merchant ships using illegal fishing
vessels poses a significant threat to world shipping. Unfortunately
counter piracy efforts and maritime security of our own and
other nation enforcement often affects the innocent fishermen
who conduct the trans-border fishing. Hence a proper vessel
monitoring system is required to protect the maritime security
without tampering the routine fishing activity of the sea going
fishermen. This paper discusses about the feasibility of a system
for the detection of registered marine fishing vessels comparing
the satellite images and GPRS signal information. A review on
various algorithms for identifying marine boats from satellite
images is also conducted in this paper.
Today, Automatic Identification System (AIS) based vessel
monitoring is used for commercial fishing vessels with the
concurrence of environmental and fisheries regulatory
organizations. AIS transponders of the system transmit the
position, time, speed and course of fishing vessels to the
center authority via radio communication [2][3]. The
limitation of such system is that, all fishing vessels may not be
equipped with AIS transponders as the cost of the equipment
is very high and it requires sufficient power to operate.
Sometimes it might be purposely switched off, damaged and
defected, the constant surveillance may be a problem [4][5].
Hence to monitor the fishing vessels and to detect illegal
activities it is very important to establish a cost effective
security surveillance system. This paper discuss about the
cost effective GPS-GPRS based vessel tracking system [6]
along with detection of marine vessels from satellite images in
comparison with GPRS signal information.
Keywords— Vessel Monitoring Systems; Satellite images;
GPRS; Trans-border fishing.

INTRODUCTION
Monitoring the marine vessels is crucial for increasing the
safety and security of the maritime traffic and preventing
illegal activities such as immigration, illegal fishery, and
smuggling in the coastal areas. Poaching is also getting a
serious problem since it will cause environmental crisis in
coastal zones. Day by day pirate attacks and merchant vessels
hijack is increasing and is a significant threat to the
international economy. Once a vessel has been hijacked, the
pirates demands a large ransom amount for the safe return of
the crew, vessel and cargo. Unfortunately counter piracy
efforts and maritime security of our own and other nation
enforcement often affects the innocent fishermen who conduct
the trans-border fishing. Many fishermen has been captured,
injured and even died as part of the counter piracy efforts and
maritime security [1]. Though the measures to combat piracy
and illegal activities cannot be unlawful, it has to be analyzed
whether there is at least reasonable apprehension of a pirate
attack or encroachment. Hence a proper vessel monitoring
system is required to protect the maritime security without
tampering the life of the fishermen and their routine fishing
activity.

In India, as shown in Fig.1, there are nine marine states
and four union tterritories [7]. The length of national coastline
is about 7516.6 km. According to UN convention on the law
of sea, the limits for the various maritime zones are divided
into three such as 12 NM- Territorial Sea, 24- NM -
Contiguous Zone and 200 NM - Exclusive Economic Zone.
Beyond 200 NM are the international waters [8].
The disadvantages of SAR based images are listed below:
 Spatial resolution is limited.
 They cannot be used to detect images of length greater
than 15m.
 Revisit time of the satellite to the target area is too long
 Human interpretation of these images is very tough and
involves polarimetric techniques to color the image.
In optical satellite imaging (OSI) system visible light
spectrum are mostly used for the imaging purpose. The
examples of optical images are shown in fig. 3.
II. GPS, GPRS AND IMAGING SATELLITE –AN OVERVIEW
A. Global Positioning System (GPS)
GPS is a satellite-based system that can be used to locate
positions anywhere on the earth. It was first developed by the
United States Department of Defense. The official name of
GPS is NAVSTAR (Navigation Satellite Timing and
Ranging).It provides a 3-dimensional positioning, continuous,
real-time, navigation and timing all over world [9][10].
B. General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)
GPRS is a Mobile Data Service accessible to Global
System for Mobile Communication (GSM). The principle
employed by GPRS is the packet radio to transport the user
data packets in a structured way between external packet data
networks and GSM mobile stations. These packets can be
routed directly to the packet switched networks from the
GPRS mobile stations. It provides an end-to-end wireless
architecture.

The advantages Optical satellite images (OSI) are as follows:
 OSI can have a higher spatial resolution, thus enabling the
detection of smaller vessels
 The human interpretation is easier than a SAR image,
without the use of polarimetry.
C. Imaging Satellite
 The tasking of an optical satellite is simpler.
The most commonly used imaging satellite system for
maritime security and identifying water vessels or fishing
boats is Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging system and
Optical Satellite Imaging (OSI) system. In SAR imaging
system, radar sends successive pulses of microwaves from a
moving platform like a satellite or an aircraft. The distance the
SAR device travels over a target creates a large synthetic
antenna aperture. The larger the aperture is, the higher the
image resolution becomes. This allows SAR to create high
resolution images with comparatively small physical antennas.
Fig.2 below shows the sample images.
The main disadvantages of optical satellites is that they
heavily depend on the weather and they can work only during
daytime [14]. Hence Optical satellites combined with SAR
satellites can effectively utilized for frequent and efficient
monitoring of the sea going vessels
III. PROPOSED SYSTEM
In the proposed system,
a unit of High Security
Registration System with GPRS (HRS-GPRS) networking is
attached to the registered sea going fishing vessels [6] at the
top of the wheel house as shown in Fig. 4. This system
comprises of GPS based location identification hardware and
GPRS data communication facility complying with marine
specifications. In the HRS-GPRS networking, high security
registration system is made up of fiber glass material
laminated with retro reflective sheeting displaying government
approved identification number with significant visibility as
shown in Fig.4.
Fig. 2. Image patches from vancouver POLSAR data [11]
The advantages of SAR based images for identifying water
vessels are [12][13] as follows
 Since the vessels are made of metal and their structure
contains sharp edges, they reflect the radar rays
intensively. Thus on the SAR images the vessels can be
identified as a bright dots having edges.
 It enables reliable operations in rainy and cloudy weather
conditions independent on sun light conditions.

Signals from HRS-GPRS system will automatically
activate immediately as the registered vessel start to sail and
the position of the vessels will be regularly updates in the
Central Monitoring System (CMS). The precompiled database
of the CMS will contain all the information regarding the
registered vessel along with the details of sailors/fisherman.
The enforcement authorities can easily track and trace the
location and identity of the sea-going registered vessels using
the above system in the GPRS connectivity area of the marine
zone. While the fishing vessel travelling beyond the GPRS
connectivity area, the communication network between the
CMS and the vessel will be lost. Though the built in GPS and
memory device in the system records the positions wherever
the registered vessel roaming in the sea area, it will be
communicated to the CMS while it come back to the
connectivity area.
given to CMS as well as to the enforcement auothorities. if it
is in the GPRS non connectivity area, check whether the
vessel is permitted in that area.If the information of the vessels
are same then send the updates of position to the CMS
otherwise give an alert to the enforcement auothorities and
CMS.
Usually the sea going fishing vessels stay in the deep sea
(GPRS-non-connectivity area) for fishing around 10-15 days.
During this period only enforcement authorities can monitor
the fishing boats. Daily thousands of vessels will stay in the
deep sea and take part in the fishing activity as fishing is one
of the major incomes for the people living in the coastal areas
of India. If any unregistered fishing boats and those displaying
fake registration numbers is being used for any illegal
activities in the national sea boundary it is very difficult to
monitor the same using the present surveillance system. Hence
to detect the illegal fishing vessels, a method is proposed here
using the satellite images in comparison with GPRS signal
information for the detection of registered marine vessels. Fig.
5 shows the schematic representation of the proposed system
and Fig. 6 shows the flow chart of registered vessel detection
by comparing the GPRS signal information and Satellite
image.
Fig. 6. Flow chart of comparion of GPRS signal & satellite image
In order to extract the information from the satllite image to
isolate and identify the fishing vessels, the various steps
involved in the image processing technique are: Image
rectification and restoration, Image enhancement, Information
extraction [15]. In image rectification and restoration
technique, geometric distortions apparent themselves as errors
in satellite images are elemenated. Image enhancement
techniques are used to improve the quality of an image as
distinguished by a human. Information extraction includes
image classification in which it classifies the images
automatically and categorizes all pixels in an image into land
cover classes and themes. The term classifier refers to a
computer program uses statistics and training data to divide
the data into groups. Information extraction algorithms are
specific to the application and most of them are shape and
feature detection algorithms [16].
Fig. 5. Schematic representation diagram of proposed system.
As per the proposed system, beyond the GPRS connectivity
area, satellite images of the coastal territory are used to
monitor the vessels. Using image extraction algorithm, the
number of vessels,time and positions are detected in the
maritime region and update to the CMS. This information is
then compared with the information obtained from GPRS
signal. If the informations are same,then no alert message is
sent to CMS and enforcement agencies. Unless check whether
the vessel is within the GPRS connectivity area or in the non
connetcivity area. If it is in the connectivity area,an alert is
There are lot of algorithms for identifying boats and other
water vessels. But they are very complex to implement and are
very costly. In this paper, apart from analysing the feasibility
of various existing algorithms for identifying boats and other
water vessels, it has been tried to develop another algorithm

using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to isolate and identify
the fishing vessels. Artificial Neural Networks are the
computing models and information-processing paradigm that
are inspired by biological neural network and provide new
directions to solve problems arising in natural tasks. Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) method would extract the relevant
features from the input data and perform a pattern recognition
task or data classification by learning from examples without
explicitly stating the rules for performing the task. The main
attributes of neural processing are its nonlinear and adaptive
learning capability, which enables machines to recognize
possible variations of a same object or pattern and/or to
identify unknown functions and mappings based on a finite set
of training data, which can be noisy with missing information.
used to study the error performance. Fig.9 shows the
simulation result. Here, Y11 is the estimated output of Poisson
distribution, Y12 is the estimated output of normal
distribution. E11is the error factor in Poisson distribution and
E12 is the error factor from normal distribution
In this ANN based method to isolate and identify the
fishing vessels; the classifier needs to be constructed based on
training data to predict the result. i.e., the number of vessel
targets to be identified to train the system. In this study
MATLAB environment is used to develop the system and the
main steps for the training process are (i) assemble the training
data, (ii) create the network object (iii) train the network (iv)
simulate the network response to new inputs. [17], [18]. In this
paper, 26 samples of satellite images are taken to train the
system. Then to test the system, two other images having 5-
vessels (image-A) and 9- vessels (image-B) is used as shown
in the Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 to detect the number of sea going
vessels.

IV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
HRS-GPRS system proposed here is a feasible and cost
effective solution for the sea going fishing vessels. It can be
designed with a two battery system which helps to provide
long life to the equipment. Also, if one of them is tampered it
can automatically send a message to the CMS and the other
one automatically switched on. This eliminates the purposeful
switched off or damage to the system as it gives the immediate
alert to the CMS. Though the coverage of the GPRS network
is limited in the maritime area which is about 25-30 km, the
system has been designed to compare the GPRS signal with
satellite images to effectively detect illegal fishing vessels in
the maritime region.
In this paper various algorithms for identifying boats and
other water vessels in satellite images are analyzed. The paper
[13] describes two steps for detecting water vessels. The first
step involves detection of features using haar wavelet. The
main purpose of using this is to reduce the in-class while
increasing the out-of-class variability compared to the raw
data and thus making classification easier. In the second step
again a classifier is used, a more complex classifier called
Adaptive Boosting. The described detection method can detect
the vessels with a good quality if the water mask is accurate
and the water doesn’t contain large waves. The classifier is
complicated to implement. Another paper [14] also explains
with two processes for identifying and isolating boats from
satellite image. The first process is the isolation of likely
candidates using component tree formation and then decides
the height related to the value of a component. From this the
component to be further processed can be decided. In the
second process machine learning algorithm and random forest
classifiers are used to detect the vessel. Though it is easy to

Also to analyze the error performance, Poisson and normal
distribution is used. A sample image contains 6 - vessels are

implement, but does not seem to be the most efficient method
for further development of methods that might be useful in
real world applications of maritime surveillance.
as it has been taken the high resolution images for processing
and image enhancement technique is also suggested to
improve the result. In another paper [16], pre- processing steps
such as: tiling, removing cloud masking using thresholding,
contrast enhancement are used before segmentation using
mathematical morphology and connected components. Again,
component tree and height based technique are used to filter
and divide the image. Also discrete wavelet transform and
radon transform are used to make certain parts more visible,
along with regressive predictor to classify candidates. It all
depends on the probability threshold. This method is also
complicated to implement and the results are seemingly
inefficient as the classifier used is little rudimentary.

While extracting the information from the satellite image to
identify the fishing vessels, it has been confronting two
distinct problems. One regarding the isolation of components
and the other related to the classification of the isolated
components to vessel or other. Many component isolation
methods are available and the most of them used are
thresholding method. But it performs poorly on maritime
vessel detection from satellite images. Hence component tree
algorithm based component isolation method is used for
maritime vessel detection
ANN method is also used here to isolate and identify the
fishing vessels. From the result obtained, it is observed that,
for an input image contains 5 nos. of vessels (image-A) as
shown in Fig. 7, the number of vessels detected is 5.0014.
Again, for an input image contains 9 nos. of vessels (image-B)
as shown in Fig. 8, number of vessels detected is 8.92. The
result shows that there is a slight difference between the input
and estimated output i.e. the error. It is learned from the result
obtained that if the system is trained with more number of
samples; more accurate results can be achieved. Also form the
error analysis conducted by Poisson and normal distribution
method, using an input image contains 6 no. vessels as shown
in Fig. 9 the output results obtained are as follows. Using
Poisson distribution, outputs is Y11=5.7923 and Normal
distribution the output is Y12=5.888. By comparing both these
results normal distribution gives the better result than Poisson
distribution.
